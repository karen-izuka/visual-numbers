      <p>Aspiring Creator of Pretty Things | Coffee Junkie | A+ Napper</p>
      <p>Hi, I'm Karen! Welcome to my website! I currently work as a financial analyst in the Bay Area, but am also a self-taught programmer and data visualization enthusiast. This is a space to share my work (with other people, but also with myself for when I forget stuff). Other than coding, I enjoy Animal Crossing, short-distance running and watching Bon Apetit on YouTube. In addition, my brain is often occupied with things such as designing the perfect excel template, searching for the softest t-shirt brand, and the many merits of sans serif fonts. I hope you find this site worth your time and thanks for stopping by!</p>
